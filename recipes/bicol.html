        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The mild sweetness of coconut milk brings a sense of delight to the sharp notes of chili pepper and bagoong in the classic Bicol Express recipe. This contrast has long created a spell-binding richness in taste for the dish. And this has helped make it arguably one of the most popular Filipino dishes.</p>
